    label: Account Inactivity
    default: "Unparked accounts that haven't visited (read: browsed) the site for 38 days (and are over 28 days old) are pruned. Parked accounts are pruned when 112 days have elapsed since the last recorded activity (read: browsed). Seeding activity does NOT count, you must BROWSE the site. Donators with a star (and ONLY donators with a star) are immune to auto-pruning. Power Users and above are also immune. We regularly clean out accounts with very low share ratios that are subject to the Ratio Watch system."
