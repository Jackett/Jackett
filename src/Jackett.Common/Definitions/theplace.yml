    default: We wish to encourage all members to participate in the communities we are creating. We have worked with the Jackett maintainers to ensure that the security and longevity of our trackers continues, and as such some torrents are removed from the results in Jackett.

    label: Account Inactivity
    default: "Unparked accounts that haven't visited (read: browsed) the site for 38 days (and are over 28 days old) are pruned. Parked accounts are pruned when 112 days have elapsed since the last recorded activity (read: browsed). Seeding activity does NOT count, you must BROWSE the site. Donators with a star (and ONLY donators with a star) are immune to auto-pruning. Power Users and above are also immune. We regularly clean out accounts with very low share ratios that are subject to the Ratio Watch system."
